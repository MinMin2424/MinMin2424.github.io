            </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Branch Management:</li>
                <li class="info">
                    The system maintains records of all company branches.
                    Each branch includes a manager, a set of employees, 
                    and a fleet of vehicles.
                </li>
                <li>Serializable Records:</li>
                <li class="info">
                    All records (branches, employees, vehicles) are 
                    serializable, allowing them to be stored and loaded from files.
                </li>
                <li>Logging and Auditing:</li>
                <li class="info">
                    All record manipulations are logged, including information 
                    about who made changes and what was modified. Record 
                    deletions are flagged as higher severity compared to other operations.
                </li>
                <li>Employee Permissions:</li>
                <li class="info">
                    Employees can view the schedule and status of each vehicle.
                    Employees can mark vehicles as unavailable for renting (e.g., due 
                    to technical issues).
                </li>
                <li>Manager Permissions:</li>
                <li class="info">
                    Managers have all employee permissions and additional capabilities 
                    to add/remove employees and vehicles, as well as modify their properties.
                </li>
                <li>Customer Features:</li>
                <li class="info">
                    Customers can browse all company branches and view available vehicles.
                    Customers can book a specific vehicle for a period of 1-30 whole days.
                </li>
                <li>Vehicle Rent Cost Calculation:</li>
                <li class="info">
                    The daily rent cost for each vehicle is calculated based on:
                    fuel price (region-dependent),
                    quarter of the fuel tank capacity,
                    a predefined margin based on vehicle type.
                </li>
                <li>Vehicle Cooldown Period:</li>
                <li class="info">
                    After each rental, a vehicle enters a three-day cooldown period during 
                    which it cannot be rented (e.g., for cleaning, inspection, etc.).
                </li>
                <li>additional Equipment Rental:</li>
                <li class="info">
                    Customers can rent additional equipment (e.g., caravan, hand truck, life 
                    jacket) at a fixed daily cost, which includes the company's margin.
                </li>
