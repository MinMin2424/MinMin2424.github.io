                CarRS is a world-leading Computer Reservation Software (CRS) 
                designed for managing and operating vehicle rental companies 
                globally. The system centralizes information about branches, 
                vehicle fleets, and their availability, serving customers,

            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Branch Management:</li>
                    <p>
                        The system maintains records of all company branches.
                        Each branch includes a manager, a set of employees, 
                        and a fleet of vehicles.
                    </p>
                    <li>Serializable Records:</li>
                    <p>
                        All records (branches, employees, vehicles) are 
                        serializable, allowing them to be stored and loaded from files.
                    </p>
                    <li>Logging and Auditing:</li>
                    <p>
                        All record manipulations are logged, including information 
                        about who made changes and what was modified. Record 
                        deletions are flagged as higher severity compared to other operations.
                    </p>
                    <li>Employee Permissions:</li>
                    <p>
                        Employees can view the schedule and status of each vehicle.
                        Employees can mark vehicles as unavailable for renting (e.g., due 
                        to technical issues).
                    </p>
                    <li>Manager Permissions:</li>
                    <p>
                        Managers have all employee permissions and additional capabilities 
                        to add/remove employees and vehicles, as well as modify their properties.
                    </p>
                    <li>Customer Features:</li>
                    <p>
                        Customers can browse all company branches and view available vehicles.
                        Customers can book a specific vehicle for a period of 1-30 whole days.
                    </p>
                    <li>Vehicle Rent Cost Calculation:</li>
                    <p>
                        The daily rent cost for each vehicle is calculated based on:
                        fuel price (region-dependent),
                        quarter of the fuel tank capacity,
                        a predefined margin based on vehicle type.
                    </p>
                    <li>Vehicle Cooldown Period:</li>
                    <p>
                        After each rental, a vehicle enters a three-day cooldown period during 
                        which it cannot be rented (e.g., for cleaning, inspection, etc.).
                    </p>
                    <li>additional Equipment Rental:</li>
                    <p>
                        Customers can rent additional equipment (e.g., caravan, hand truck, life 
                        jacket) at a fixed daily cost, which includes the company's margin.
                    </p>
                </ul>
