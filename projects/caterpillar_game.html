            </h2>
            <p>
                The objective of this project was to design and develop a game 
                in which the player controls a caterpillar moving across a game board 
                with dimensions of 40x20 (configurable to adjust width, height, or both). 
                The player's goal is to collect cabbages for one point and strawberries 
                for two points that randomly appear on the game board. 
                Each collected cabbage and strawberry increases the length of the 
                caterpillar, progressively increasing the game's difficulty. 
                The game ends if the caterpillar collides with the edges of 
                the game board or with itself.
