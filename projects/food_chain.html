                The "Food Chain" project focuses on implementing a system to track 
                the flow of food using a simplified blockchain-based approach. 
                The system ensures that the journey of food products can be traced 
                through various stages of the process, from cultivation to sale to 
                the end customer. This includes all phases such as processing, 
                storage, distribution, and other related operations.
