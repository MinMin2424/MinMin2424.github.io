                This application serves as a school information system designed to 
                manage and promote voluntary events (e.g., orientation events, barbecues, 
                competitions, excursions, etc.) and lectures related to the field of study. 
                It enables students to explore various activities and participate in 
                those that interest them, while providing useful information and 
                interactive features to simplify registration and attendance tracking. <br> <br>
                The system is primarily intended for students seeking opportunities to enrich 
                their education through diverse events and lectures. 
                Additionally, it offers organizers a tool for promoting and managing 
                these activities effectively.
