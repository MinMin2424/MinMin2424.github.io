                    Developed a mobile application for the Android platform using Kotlin. 
                    The app provides users with a list of existing movies along with 
                    detailed information, including descriptions, episode counts, 
                    country of origin, and more. Additionally, users can interact with 
                    the application by adding comments and saving movies to their favorites.
                    Users can navigate between screens using bottom navigation, 
                    ensuring a smooth and intuitive experience.
                    <br> <br>
                    Currently, the application consists of five main screens:
                </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Main Screen:</li>
                    <li class="info">
                        Displays a list of movies available in the application.
                    </li>
                    <li>Description Screen:</li>
                    <li class="info">
                        Provides detailed information about a selected movie. 
                        At the bottom of the screen, users can share their opinions 
                        by adding comments and reading those posted by others.
                    </li>
                    <li>Favorite Screen:</li>
                    <li class="info">
                        Serves as a space where users can store their favorite movies and 
                        track their ratings.
                    </li>
                    <li>Profile Screen:</li>
