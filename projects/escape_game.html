                        The game is implemented entirely in Java, including all core mechanics 
                        and logic. Object-oriented principles are used to structure the code

                        The user interface is developed using JavaFX. It handles rendering, 
                        user interactions, and visual components such as buttons, inventory 
                        management, and movement controls.

                        The game state is stored in JSON files, which contain all relevant data, 
                        including the positions of all game elements and the items in 
                        the player's inventory.
