                Developed an information system for managing hotels and hotel 
                chains, enabling administrators to track key details such as 
                location, contact information, and official ratings. The system 
                facilitates efficient management of hotel data, including adding 
                new hotels to the chain and updating existing records.

                    <li>Database Design and Management:</li>
                    <p>
                        The project began with the creation and management 
                        of a database in PostgreSQL using pgAdmin. <br>
                        Tables were designed with specific parameters to store 
                        hotel-related data (e.g., hotel name, location, contact information, rating). <br>
                        Data was inserted into the respective tables, and queries were written to 
                        retrieve or combine data from multiple tables into a single result.
                    </p>
                    <li>Implementation in Java</li>
                    <p>
                        After the database structure was finalized, the system was implemented in Java 
                        to provide a user-friendly interface and additional functionality. <br>
                        Key features implemented include CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) 
                        for managing hotel records. <br>
                        Search functionality was added to find hotels by name, ID, or other criteria.
